Module input_sequence_reader reads input sequences having header information plus a series of 
operations. The fields listed below can be listed in any order, with the following exceptions:

Comment lines come directly after the line indicating how many comment lines there are.
Operation lines come directly after the line indicating how many operation lines there are.
Operation lines have two, three, or four columns depending on whether they contain feedback and indexes

FALSE = 0
TRUE = 1
FAILURE = 0
SUCCESS = 1
READ = 0
WRITE = 1
DELETE = 2
EVICT = 3
